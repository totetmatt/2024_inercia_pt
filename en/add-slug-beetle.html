<p><br /><img src="../images/slug_beetle.jpg" /><br />Slug Beetle is one of the best-kept secrets in Portuguese electronic music but, for those paying attention, Edgar Matos was already a familiar presence in the world of abstract hip-hop beats, experimental music and digging through his pseudonym Mo Junkie. An avid collector of deviant vinyl and a beatmaker with an in-depth knowledge of production techniques - which he uses to create some of the least conformist music on our music scene - Edgar lives this music with a rare intensity. As a DJ he can take us to visit the various dark corners of his vast collection, stringing together pearls of Turkish funk, library music, psych-rock, 80s new age, disco, 80s soul and even techno with an impressive sense of narrative.</p>
