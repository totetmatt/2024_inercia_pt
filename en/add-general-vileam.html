As a founding member of the <a href="https://www.instagram.com/assohicetnunc/">Hic Et Nunc Association</a>, <a href="https://soundcloud.com/general-vileam">General Vileam</a> is an "habitu√©" of European dark alternative circles, and now spends most of his time in Portugal. It was during a mix session on the island of Madeira that he discovered in a newspaper article that this stage name had been given to him. So he decided to keep it.<br /><br />
His musical references are often quite different from those of the Portuguese scene, so he spreads his love of alternative music while continuing to enrich his past and present catalogue through shares with his new friends.<br /><br />
And although he often likes to put on disturbing masks, he's no less friendly : don't hesitate to ask him which band he's playing, he'll be happy to open the doors to his musical universe : Cold, Minimal, Synthpunk, Goth, Postpunk, French Underground, Witch House...<br /><br />
Yeah. Every day's Halloween. Even under the sun!</p>
