				<h2 tabindex="-1" class="blueh -h4">About Inércia</h2>
				<p>Inércia is organized by <a href="https://inercia.pt">Associação Inércia</a>, a non profit organization dedicated to promoting the demoscene. 2024 will be the 16th edition of Inércia we organize and the fifth taking place in Almada.</p>
				<p>Inércia 2024 will take place in December 2024, from 6th to the 8th at <b>Salão Festas Incrível Almadense</b>, the centenary event hall in the heart of Almada, just across the river from Lisbon.</p>
				<p>This mythical hall provides us with room for up to 150 visitors (including dedicated table spots with comfortable seating for up to 50 people). The event runs from Friday afternoon until Sunday morning, during which there will be plenty of opportunity to present your work and socialize with other artists, demosceners and hardware tinkerers.</p>
				
				<h2 tabindex="-1" class="blueh -h4">About the Demoscene</h2>
				<p>The Demoscene is an international computer art subculture focused on producing so-called demos: self-contained, sometimes extremely small, computer programs that display audiovisual content. The purpose of a demo is to show off programming, visual art, and musical skills.</p>
				<p>Demoscene community organizes regular events to compete and socialize called demoparties: physical social events, usually over a weekend, focused on presenting new demoscene content. They typically feature competitions of several categories, seminars about relevant demoscene topics and live performances of music and visuals.</p>
				<p>Inércia is a demoparty, but also embraces other digital art cultures, hence being defined as a digital arts and music festival.</p>
				
				<h2 id="new-to-the-demoscene%3F" tabindex="-1" class="blueh -h4">What is the event like?</h2>
				<p>Never visited a demoparty? Haven't been to one in a while? This is what you can expect:</p>
				<p>The focus on Friday is to arrive, claim a spot at one of the tables, unpack your things, get to know everyone and finish your production to be submitted to the party system. Meanwhile we will screen some demos on the bigscreen, hand host a talk or a workshop planned before dinner. After dinner we will host the 4th edition of the Shader Royale, the worlds largest simultaneous livecoding event, where we will have participants from all corners of the world (some sitting in our hall), programming visuals in realtime for our liveact / DJ sets. You are welcome to join in if you know shader coding. Noise curfew on location is at midnight but we are planning an afterparty at a local nightclub.</p>
                <p>Saturday morning is typically for finishing your submissions, sleeping late or exploring the charming downtown of Almada.<br>We will have several different talks and events scheduled throughout the day. Competitions and showcases will begin later in the afternoon, where participants have their productions presented on our large screen with stage and soundsystem. After dinner we will have the highlight of the event: the realtime intro and demo competitions. Noise curfew on location is at midnight but we are planning an afterparty at a local nightclub.</p>
                <p>Sunday mornings start slowly with some light socializing activities and culminate with the prizegiving / closing ceremony. The doors will close with a community lunch amongst the organizers and remaining visitors, your final opportunity to network.</p>
