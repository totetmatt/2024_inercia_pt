          <p>Free entrance to our volunteer organizers or associates of <a href="http://inercia.pt"
              target="_blank">Associação Inércia</a> or <a href="https://incrivelalmadense.pt" target="_blank">SFIA</a>
            with their yearly quotas paid.</p>
		  <p>Being a member of Associação Inércia costs you 24eur per year, half if you're a student or unemployed. So it's effectively cheaper to become a member and pay the yearly quota then the regular entrance ticket. We want you to become an active member of the association.</p>

		  <p>Too expensive? Just curious to check the vibe for little while? Wanted to bring a friend but they are not sure if it's for them? Well, you're in luck! Besides the free entrance on Friday afternoon with a guided tour that we had already announced, we are also now announcing a "bring a buddy for a visit" system, where each paying member can have a +1 visiting the event for up to one hour. No registration needed, just ask about it at the infodesk. No excuses left not to attend Inércia 2024!</p>
