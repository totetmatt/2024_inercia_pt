The all important website for Inércia 2024 demoparty!

Hacked together from NOVA 2024 demoparty reference website (with permission). Because doing websites is fucking boring. Please volunteer to do Inércia 2025 website if you disagree!

Directly updates on https://2024.inercia.pt

# TODO

- add press kit info and download link for it on contact page
- add link to download the invitation somewhere on website (and short paragraph about it)
- add fast theme competition to participate page
- photo + paragraph about shader royale jam on schedule
- optimize size of some of the heavier images
- add team information on contact page (maybe not needed?)
